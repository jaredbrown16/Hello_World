# Hello_World

Hi World,

My name is Jared and I am a senior at the university of Iowa. I am currently looking for a full-time job. 

# **Project Title**

*Data Wrangling Project* 

# **Project Description** 

Looked at state crime compared with state demographic data to find any insights on:  1. where 2. who  3. what type of people are commiting certain types of crimes.   

# **Methods**

We used R and RSocrata to pull data from different sources. We then merged the two data sets to get a better picture of things as a whole and simplicity in our analysis. Ran different correaltion tests and created visuals to come up with insights.

# **Findings**

We found the the number one indicator correalted with crime was poverty along with population density at number two. This means bigger cities expereince more crime and people with lower poverty are more inclined to commit crimes/ be arrested. We also found that the region with highest crime rates was the South.
